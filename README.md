# Spotify-Archive
Ever felt like you need to clean your Spotify library but wanted to save those once-golden tracks? Here is a repo for this. Just replace the credentials and hit run!
The code will first save the names of the tracks and the names of the artists from your saved tracks in a .txt file
Then it will go through your playlists and save the tracks from each playlist in seperate .txt files just as mentioned above.
Navigate to Sptify > Profile and get the digits in the url after user/ as user id (e.g. https://open.spotify.com/user/11131765432, user id is "11131765432")
